This is a "git" repository. You can view, copy/paste, etc. any file directly from here.

You may also "clone" the code to your local machine. Create a Git account and return
to this page. At the top right you will see a button that should allow you to
"Clone or Download" this code. Do so if you would like direct access to these files
without a lot of Ctrl+C/Ctrl+V action.
